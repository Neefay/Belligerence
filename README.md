Please however do keep in mind: this is barely scraping the surface of all of the UI features, inner-workings of the more complex algorithms, etc. I would need an entire team just in order to document this project in its full extent.

## BUILDING

Instructions soon. I'll need to cook up a .env template along with all of the other instructions and that's currently beyond my scope.

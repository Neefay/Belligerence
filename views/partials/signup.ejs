					After the global crisis which followed the fall of Greater Israel, the ensuing apocalyptic economic scenario forced many countries into complete bankrupcy, and its now unemployed citizens were then forced to find ways to make ends meet. Thus began the boom of the private defense industry, which after many legal battles fought over the years, is now a fully fledged recognized part of many international protocols.

				<div class="block">
					We hope you will join us in a bold and exciting adventure, and secure the future you deserve.

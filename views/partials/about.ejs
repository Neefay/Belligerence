								<p>
									I'll leave this project's long and nearly nearly auto-biographical proper post-mortem for later - for now, I'll just try my best to describe the thoughts that come to my head when thinking about this whole ordeal.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="text-list size-medium spacing">
								<h4>Cause</h4>
								<p>
									Portfolio, mostly. And I say mostly because there's obviously that part inside of me that always wanted to actually try my hand at makig a video game, or at least the closest thing I could excuse myself to. Initially this was just going to be a simple app to prove my (assumed) proficiency in AngularJS (keep in mind this was 2015) and as a funny hook, connect with ArmA 3, a favorite video game of mine, through some mySQL library. Boy, did it escalate from here.
								</p>
								<p>
									I wanted to create something that would give players a sense of persistence, a sense of meaning and weight to every action and mission, that winning <i>this one fire-fight</i> could change the course of the entire community, that even while you were in-game, you were part of a living and breathing system much larger than a single person.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="text-list size-medium spacing">
								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<p>
									I'll try not to get too long winded for now about this. Let's just say that once you have games like Jagged Alliance 2, MGS5, and 7.62 as your main inspirations, there's a lot in your head you have to live up to - and once you finish that sweet design doc and think to yourself "<i>Yeah, should take about a year give it or take.</i>", remember that you might be like me and be absolutely awful at over-estimating yourself.
								</p>
								<p>
									As it turns out, doing something is easy. But doing something the way you want it, that's where your blood and sweat will drop. Even though I've had to axe a bunch of features or leave them for later, the way things I expected to finish in one night took an entire week (or longer) made me realize that getting things the way I wanted wasn't gonna be anywhere like I imagined in my head.
								</p>
								<p>
									After this project became my full-time occupation, I've had to develop habits like using time management techniques (üçÖ), keeping an ever-expanding to-do list (well over 5000 lines at this point), and by the end, even track my progress or lack-thereof with a calendar, just so I had a projection on when I'd be done. I missed that projection by three months btw, which reminds me: <i>always take your estimated time to complete any given task, and multiply it by three or four</i>. Trust me, it's for your own health.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="text-list size-medium spacing">
								<h4>Consequences</h4>
								<p>
									What can I say? This is a world where people are measured by their results, not their words or promises. I suppose this is the largest lesson I've taken from this project, the look on people's face once you've been telling them "just one more thing" for years now. How you yourself lose the ability to even feel excited about finishing a feature because you know it's just some file processing algorithm no one will understand anyway even though it took you the whole month. I mean for God's sake, for an entire year all I had was server-side stuff, printed onto a console, nothing else. Try justifying your life to your loved ones when all you have is the same empty promises that this "thing" you're working on will one day do all of those incredible things, and watch as they go from raising their eye-brows to openly mocking you to outright saying they've lost all faith in you. Just thinking about it makes me depressed.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is already too long, so I'll wrap it up. The consequences of this project, is that I've learned the true meaning of the word "support". Once you've hit the third year slaving away with barely any palpable results, the worst part won't be doubting yourself, but when others do, too. And of course, the best part will be when they give you a (literal or not) pat on the back and say "<i>You can do it!</i>". It may sound stupid, but just thinking of all the people who stood by my side when I had not one hint of self-considence brings tears to my grown-man eyes. Just a simple note of encouragement had the power to keep me going for nights on end; a short inquiry about the progress motivated me to have something to show for the next week.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>BELLIGERENCE</strong> took 3 years and a few months from concept to this point. It's by far the largest undertaking I've ever done in my life and what I would call my magnum opus. It's changed my friendships, my relationships - it's changed me, permanently. I hope you conclude it was worth it. I know it was.
